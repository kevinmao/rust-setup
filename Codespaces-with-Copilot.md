# External Lab: Using GitHub Codespaces with Copilot


_This is an external lab which will require you to continue in GitHub._

For this ungraded lab you will use GitHub Codespaces in your environment. To accomplish this, you will use the template repository.

1.  Head over to the [template repository](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) and click on the green "Use this template" button, or use the [following link to create it](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup/generate).
    
2.  Launch a Codespace and make sure you are authenticated with GitHub
    
3.  Follow the steps in [the lab document](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup/blob/main/lab.md)
    
4.  Make a change to your newly created repository, commit, and push it.
    

**The end objective** is that you have a repository in your own account that has used the template repository which includes GitHub Copilot.

Tip: If you are a student or have an .edu email account, you can validate your status with GitHub and access GitHub Copilot for free by following [this guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/step-by-step-setting-up-github-student-and-github-copilot-as-an/ba-p/3736279).
